					"item-content": "<p>Metastatic colorectal cancer is generally treated initially with a regimen of fluorouracil and leucovorin plus either oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or irinotecan (FOLFIRI). Patients cross over to the alternate regimen for second-line therapy. The antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab has been shown to increase survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in the first-line setting when added to FOLFIRI and in the second-line setting when added to FOLFOX, but no biologic agent has been shown to improve survival in the second-line setting when added to FOLFIRI.</p><p>Aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein that targets three factors that contribute to tumor angiogenesis: vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), VEGFB, and placental growth factor (PlGF). In a multinational phase III study sponsored by Sanofi, Van Cutsem et al added aflibercept to FOLFIRI as second-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer previously treated with oxaliplatin. Prior bevacizumab was allowed, but not prior irinotecan.</p><p>Between 2007 and 2010, a total of 1226 patients were randomized to receive aflibercept 4 mg/kg (n = 612) or placebo (n = 614) on day 1 every 2 weeks, followed by the FOLFIRI regimen (irinotecan 180 mg/m2, leucovorin 400 mg/m2, and fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 bolus and then 2400 mg/m2 by continuous infusion). Crossover to aflibercept after progression on placebo was not permitted.</p><p>At the February 2011 cutoff date for analysis of overall survival (OS), the primary endpoint, median follow-up was 22.28 months. The patients receiving aflibercept/FOLFIRI had a median survival of 13.50 months compared with 12.06 months for the placebo/FOLFIRI control patients (hazard ratio [HR], 0.817; P = .0032). At 2 years, survival rates were 28.0% and 18.7%, respectively. The treatment effect favoring aflibercept held in analyses of prespecified subgroups based on prior bevacizumab use and various patient characteristics at baseline.</p><p>Progression-free survival (PFS) increased from 4.7 months for controls to 6.9 months with use of aflibercept (HR, 0.758; P &lt; .0001). Subgroup analyses showed a consistent trend in PFS in favor of aflibercept. The response rate in patients with measurable disease was significantly higher with aflibercept vs placebo (19.8% vs 11.1%; P &lt; .001).</p><p>Grade 3 and 4 adverse events were more common with aflibercept than placebo (83.5% vs 62.5%, respectively). Toxicities related to anti-VEGF treatment were consistent with those reported in previous studies. Interestingly, some common adverse events related to treatment with FOLFIRI were more frequent in the aflibercept arm. These included grade 3 and 4 diarrhea, asthenia, stomatitis, infections, and palmar&#8211;plantar erythrodysesthesia, as well as grade 3 and 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenic complications.</p><p>The addition of aflibercept to FOLFIRI led to a relative reduction in the risk of death of 18.3%, compared with placebo/FOLFIRI. The early and continued divergence of the survival curves further supports the clinical value of the aflibercept results. Survival rates for aflibercept vs placebo were 38.5% vs 30.9% at 18 months, 28.0% vs 18.7% at 24 months, and 22.3% vs 12.0% at 30 months.</p><p>The authors concluded that aflibercept plus FOLFIRI may be a new therapeutic option for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer patients whose disease has progressed while on or after completion of an oxaliplatin-based regimen.</p>",
