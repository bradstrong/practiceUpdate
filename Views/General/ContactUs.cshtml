            <dd class="faq-a">
                If you already have an account, try another email address you may have used or <a href="/User/ForgotPassword">reset your password</a>.  If you didn&rsquo;t validate your account when you first registered, that may be the issue. When you sign up initially, you enter your email, password and location. Then, we send you an email with a link to validate your registration request. Look for the email (it may take a few minutes), click the link in the message and then complete your Profile &amp; Settings information. If you do not get an email, try registering again or check your junk/spam folder. If it&rsquo;s not there, just send let us know and we&rsquo;ll get things fixed for you.
