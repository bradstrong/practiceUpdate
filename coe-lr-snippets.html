<h2>Diagnosis</h2>

<h2>Differential Diagnosis</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Transitional cell carcinomas of the renal pelvis (8% of all renal cancers)</li>
  <li>Wilms&rsquo; tumor</li>
  <li>Other rare primary renal carcinomas and sarcomas</li>
  <li>Renal cysts</li>
  <li>All causes of hematuria (see Section II)</li>
  <li>Retroperitoneal tumors</li>
</ul>

<h2>Workup</h2>
<p>Laboratory tests and imaging studies</p>

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Urinalysis: hematuria</li>
  <li>Complete blood count: anemia or erythrocytosis</li>
  <li>Nonmetastatic hepatic dysfunction with elevated alkaline phosphatase, prolonged pro-thrombin time, and hypoalbuminemia</li>
  <li>Hypercalcemia (caused by parathyroid-related protein)</li>
  <li>Other: elevated ferritin, elevated insulin and glucagon levels, elevated alpha-fetoprotein, and elevated beta-human chorionic gonadotropin</li>
  <li>Recent reports indicate that urine AQP1 and ADFP concentrations quantified by Western blot appear to be sensitive and specific biomarkers of kidney cancers of proximal tubule origin and may be useful to diagnose an imaged renal mass and screen for kidney cancer at an early stage. Additional investigations are under way to determine if these tests should become standard tumor markers in the investigation of renal masses.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Imaging Studies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Nearly 50% of renal cancers are now detected because a renal mass is incidentally detected on radiographic evaluation.</li>
  <li>Renal ultrasound</li>
  <li>Abdominal CT scan with contrast (Figs. 1-712 and 1-713); CT-guided biopsy is generally not necessary for diagnosis of solid masses &gt;4 cm (high likelihood of cancer)</li>
  <li>MRI</li>
  <li>Renal arteriogram</li>
  <li>Intravenous pyelography</li>
</ul>

<h2>Staging</h2>
<p>See Table 1-356.</p>

<p>Therapeutically relevant biologic pathways in renal cell carcinoma. In conditions of normoxia and normal von Hippel&ndash;Lindau (VHL) gene function, VHL protein is the substrate recognition component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets hypoxia-inducible factor-&alpha; (HIF-&alpha;) for prote&not;olysis. In cellular hypoxia or with an inactivated VHL gene, the VHL protein&ndash;HIF interaction is disrupted, which leads to stabilization or accumulation of HIF transcription factors. HIF accumulation can also result from activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) downstream of cellular stimuli and the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. mTOR phosphorylates and activates p70S6 kinase (p70S6K), which leads to enhanced translation of certain proteins, including HIF. Activated mTOR also phosphorylates 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), which promotes dissociation of this complex and allow a eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E) to stimulate an increase in the translation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that encode cell cycle regulators, such as c-myc and cyclin D1. Activated HIF translocates into the nucleus and leads to transcription of a large repertoire of hypoxia-inducible genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). These ligands bind to their cognate receptors pres&not;ent on the surface of endothelial cells, which leads to cell migration, proliferation, and permeability. Sites of action of targeted therapies are illustrated. Temsirolimus and everolimus bind to FK506-binding protein (FKBP), and the resultant protein-drug complex inhibits the kinase activity of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). Bevacizumab is a VEGF ligand&ndash;binding antibody. Sunitinib, sorafenib, axitinib, and pazopanib are small-molecule inhibitors of multiple tyrosine kinase receptors, including the receptors for VEGF (VEGFR) and PDGF (PDGFR).

<h2>Cytoreductive Nephrectomy in Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Two randomized studies have demonstrated improved sur&not;vival in carefully selected metastatic RCC patients undergo&not;ing cytoreductive nephrectomy followed by cytokine therapy (interferon-&alpha;) compared with those receiving cyto&not;kine therapy alone.</li>
  <li>Several patient and/or disease characteristics appear to influ&not;ence outcome; patients with poor performance status, comorbid medical conditions, rapidly progressive disease, presence of brain metastases, and so on, are unlikely to benefit from this approach.</li>
  <li>The role of cytoreductive nephrectomy as a prelude to sys&not;temic therapy with currently available novel targeted agents is unclear and is the subject of ongoing clinical trials.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Metastasectomy</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Resection of isolated metastatic lesions is appropriate in selected patients.</li>
  <li>Several retrospective studies have suggested that patients undergoing complete resection of isolated metastatic foci may experience long disease-free intervals, with median overall survival rates of 35% to 50% in some reports.</li>
  <li>Several factors are associated with an improved outcome after metastasectomy, including complete resection, pres&not;ence of solitary metastatic lesions, age younger than 60 years, smaller tumor size, presence of pulmonary metastases, and development of metachronous metastatic disease.</li>
  <li>There are no prospective, randomized studies demonstrating a favorable outcome with metastasectomy. It is therefore possible that the favorable outcome after resection of limited metastatic disease may be a reflection of patient selection bias, differences in tumor biology and natural history, or other confounding factors not related to resection.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Palliative Surgery in Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In some patients with advanced RCC, cytoreductive nephrec&not;tomy may help alleviate symptoms related to the primary tumor (e.g., intractable pain, hematuria) or paraneoplastic manifestations.</li>
  <li>However, nonsurgical options are often effective in palliat&not;ing symptoms associated with RCC; cytoreductive nephrec&not;tomy is hence infrequently performed with purely palliative intent.</li>
  <li>Resection of metastatic lesions (often in combination with radiation or systemic therapy) is sometimes performed for relief of symptoms or to prevent life-threatening or dis&not;abling sequelae.</li>
</ul>
